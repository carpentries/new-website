At The Carpentries, we are committed to creating a vibrant, inclusive community that meets the diverse needs of our members and supports our mission to build capacity in the data science and coding community. As we strive to improve and adapt our membership offerings, we need your help!

**We Want to Hear From You**

We are launching a survey to gather valuable feedback from our current and past Member organisations. This is an opportunity for you to share your thoughts on how we can enhance our membership model, better align with your organisationâ€™s needs, and ensure that we provide the most meaningful benefits to our community.

**Why Your Feedback Matters**

Your insights will directly influence our efforts to build a more inclusive and effective membership program. We are especially interested in hearing your thoughts on:

- **New services or benefits** that you would like to see added to our membership offerings.
- **Improvements** to our current offerings to better align with your organisation's needs.
- **Strategies** that could enhance our relationship with your organisation.

We are also looking to understand if any aspects of our current membership offerings might hinder you from renewing or starting a membership in the future.

**How to Participate**

Participating in the survey is simple and only takes a few minutes. Your responses will remain confidential, and the data collected will be used solely to improve our services and better support you and your organisation.

**Take the [Survey](https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/cSkqdrOL) now (or before 1 October) for a chance to win an Instructor Training seat in our lucky draw!**

**Stay Connected**

We have also noticed that some members may not be aware of all the communication channels we offer. To ensure that you are always up to date with our latest news, events, and opportunities, please take a moment to join our Slack channel and sign up for our email updates:

- **Sign up to our [newsletter](https://carpentries.org/newsletter/)**

**Thank You for Your Participation!**

We deeply appreciate your time and effort in helping us grow and adapt. Your feedback is crucial in shaping the future of The Carpentries and ensuring we continue to serve our community effectively.

Thank you for being a part of The Carpentries community. We look forward to your input!
