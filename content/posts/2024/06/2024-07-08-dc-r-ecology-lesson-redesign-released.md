Those visiting the [Data Carpentry _Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Ecologists_ lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/) today might notice things have changed!
The redesigned version of the lesson, [approved for adoption by the Curriculum Advisory Committee](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/03/dc-r-ecology-adoption/) earlier this year, has now replaced the previous content.

The former version was [released to Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12684301) before the redesigned content was merged into the lesson, and the files and folders of that version can be downloaded from there or [accessed through the history of the lesson repository](https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson/tree/6a5ab5e94985b3b528bdb9b7455bf4f6b238e20c).

## What happens next?

- **Teach the lesson!** Data Carpentry Ecology workshops teaching R should include this redesigned lesson from now on. 
- **Give feedback!** Feedback from Instructors and suggestions for how the lesson could be improved -- 
  always welcome across all lessons! -- 
  are particularly vital for the success of this updated content.
  To make your contribution, please [open an issue on the lesson repository](https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson/issues/new/choose), submit a pull request, or [send an email to the Curriculum Team](mailto:curriculum@carpentries.org) that we can pass on to the lesson Maintainers.
- **Help update other lessons!** Curriculum Advisors and Lesson Program Governors have identified relatively large updates needed on a number of other Carpentries lessons. 
  If you would like to collaborate with other community members to redesign and refresh another lesson, please [get in touch](mailto:curriculum@carpentries.org).
