We are pleased to announce that our most recent cohort of Lesson Maintainers have completed onboarding and are ready to support lessons across The Carpentries curricula. 26 new Maintainers participated in the two hour [onboarding](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/), with the following goals:

- Orientation to The Carpentries goals and vision for lesson maintanence
- Getting connected with other Maintainers and the overall Maintainer community
- Developing skills for creating a positive environment for all contributors
- Becoming familiar with the key components of the lesson template
- Learning how and when to elevate issues to the Curriculum Advisory Committee

New and existing Maintainers were also invited to join a two hour [GitHub Skill-up](https://carpentries.github.io/github-skill-up-maintainers/), aiming to teach them how to:

- Manage issues more effectively with labels, referencing, and automatic closure
- Use GitHub’s comment and suggestion features to review pull requests
- Resolve simple merge conflicts using the GitHub web interface

We are excited to welcome these new members to the Maintainer community and look forward to working with them, and continuing to work with our many committed continuing Maintainers, over the coming months.
