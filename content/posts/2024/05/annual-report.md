We are pleased to announce that [The Carpentries 2023 Annual Report](/files/reports/AnnualReport2023.pdf) is now available on the 
[Reports](/reports/) page, our central resource for all reports including yearly reports, grant reports, 
and assessment reports released by The Carpentries. 

This year we dissolved the distinction between the Annual and the Financial Reports and merged both into one Annual Report. The 
Annual Report provides highlights of the work the Core Team and community achieved in 2023, and also provides some priorities for 2024. 
It includes messages from our Executive Director, Dr. Kari L. Jordan, and from our newly-constituted Board of Directors. It also shares 
key financial data on our income and expenditures over the course of 2023, giving insight to our continued financial stability for 
supporting our mission. Additional details about our 2023 financials can be found in our 
[Financial Statement](/files/reports/FinancialStatement2023.pdf).

## Thank You

We are grateful to the Board of Directors, the Team Leads, and our Executive Director for their contributions to the report and for 
reviewing it in the draft phase. And a big thank you, always, to everyone in The Carpentries community for the many ways in which you 
contribute to progressing this organisation and its community from strength to strength, year after year. We could never achieve all that 
we do without your generous support.
